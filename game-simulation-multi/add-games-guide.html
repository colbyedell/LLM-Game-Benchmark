    <h1><strong>Adding Your Own Games to the LLM Game Simulation</strong></h1>
    <div id="add-games-guide">
        This guide will instruct you on how to add games to the LLM Benchmark.<br><br>
        The example code in this guide is based on our Tic-Tac-Toe implementation.<br><br>
        You can copy/paste the code examples provided in this guide into your IDE and modify them as instructed.<br><br>

This method may be modified for non-grid-based games.<br><br>

                        For example, if player 1 (X) in tic-tac-toe has placed in the first row/column and the last (3rd) row/column, the list returned from listPlayerMoves(1) would be [“1,1”, “3,3”].

Begin by checking whether each JSON value you requested from the LLM exists and is of the correct type; if not, throw an error. After that, validate the move according to the rules of your game. If the move is valid, update your game board accordingly and return a new Move object with the “Valid” outcome. If the move is invalid, determine the type of invalid move and return a new Move object with an outcome matching the type of invalid move.<br><br>

                        Implement the static visualizeBoardState() function, which will be used to generate the board visualizations for the text file logs. This should return a text-based visualization of the board, with each line of the visualization followed by a newline character \n. Append another \n to the visualization for proper spacing in the text file log.<br><br>

                        Note that this method is very similar to the drawBoard method, with the main difference being that we add vertical separators | between each space here, while we do not add separators in the drawBoard() method. If you’d like your text file logs to be the same as your “illustration” prompts, you can replace the logic in the function below with the same board visualization logic from your drawBoard() implementation.
