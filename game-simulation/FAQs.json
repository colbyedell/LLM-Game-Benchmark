    "Question": "How do I use the game simulation page?",
    "Answer": "Please click the User Guide button on the game simulation page for written and video guides on how to use the page."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Can I submit results for a new LLM?",
    "Answer": "Yes, we appreciate contributions to the benchmarks as results from new game runs. Please use the game simulation code to enter your LLM information and then send the files generated by the 'Game Simulation' web app to be added to the leaderboard. Please send the data to research.explorations at gmail address."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Do you accept results from LLMs trained for the games at the benchmark?",
    "Answer": "No, we expect the LLMs not specifically trained for the games at the benchmark."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Can I add my own games to the simulation page?",
    "Answer": "Yes, please click the How to Add Your Own Game button on the game simulation page for more details."

  {
    "Question": "What are the log files generated for each game?",
    "Answer": "For each game, log files are generated using the prefix 'game-type_prompt-type_first-player_second-player_game-result_timestamp'. For each game, CSV, JSON, and TXT files are generated containing information about the game. The JSON, TXT, and '_moves.csv' files contain detailed information about each move. If you checked the 'Save Progress Images in ZIP File' checkbox, a screenshot of the board for each move will also be generated. After all games have been played, '_submission' JSON and CSV files will be generated, containing aggregated information about all of the games played. For bulk runs, the aforementioned files will be generated for each combination, and 'all_moves' and 'all_submission' JSON/CSV files will be generated containing all moves and submission files generated during the bulk run, as well as an '_all.csv' file containing all CSV rows generated during the bulk run."

  {
    "Question": "What does the # of Games entry box do?",
    "Answer": "The number you put in this field dictates the number of matches that will be played with your current settings (game type, prompt type, and first/second player LLM selections). For bulk runs, this is the number of matches that will be played with each combination of LLMs."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What does the Run button do?",
    "Answer": "The Run button will run games with the current settings (game type, prompt type, first/second player LLMs, and # of games). Once gameplay finishes, generated log files will be downloaded in a 'game-type_prompt-type_first-player_second-player_timestamp.zip' file."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What does the Bulk Run button do?",
    "Answer": "The Bulk Run button will run games with every possible combination of LLMs you've added. The '# of Games' you've entered will be played for each combination, and all of the resulting files will be downloaded in a bulk ZIP file once the run finishes. To prevent the same an LLM from playing against itself during a bulk run, uncheck the 'Allow LLMs to Play Against Themselves in Bulk Runs' checkbox."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What does the Progress Display Type option do?",
    "Answer": "This option allows you to change the type of move visualization used in the progress displays (located to the left and right sides of the game board for the first and second player, respectively). This option does not impact the log files in any way; it is purely for visualization purposes."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What does the Auto-Scroll Progress Displays checkbox do?",
    "Answer": "This checkbox, when checked, will automatically scroll the progress displays (located to the left and right sides of the game board for the first and second player, respectively) downward whenever a new move is made. Leave this unchecked if you'd like to scroll the progress displays freely."
